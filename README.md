# Global Temperatures

This project was developed for DS-325 Advanced Statstics. I took this class at Carroll College in the Fall of 2021.

The goal of this project was to look at Global Temperatures data find ways to visualize and draw conclusions from it. We were also tasked with finding a dataset and exploring the effect global temperatures have on the new data. In this instanced we used wildfire data and compared how temperature affected them. 

The project writeup can be found in the Project-1_Bathon.html file.
